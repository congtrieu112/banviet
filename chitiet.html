          A business (also known as enterprise or firm) is an organization designed to provide goods, services, or both to consumers.[1] Businesses are predominant in capitalist economies, in which most of them are privately owned and formed to earn profit to increase the wealth of their owners. Businesses may also form not-for-profit or be state-owned. A business owned by multiple individuals may be referred to as a company, although that term also has a more precise meaning.
